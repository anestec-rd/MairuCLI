  "date": "February 1, 2017",
  "company": "GitLab",
  "what_happened": "A tired engineer accidentally ran 'rm -rf' on the wrong database server during a stressful incident, deleting 300GB of production data. The command was meant for a test server but was executed on the primary database instead.",
  "impact": [
    "300GB of production database data deleted",
    "6 hours of user data lost (issues, merge requests, comments)",
    "18 hours of downtime for GitLab.com",
    "Affected thousands of users and projects worldwide",
    "Exposed backup system failures (5 out of 5 backup methods failed)"
  ],

  "lesson": "Even experienced engineers make mistakes under stress. This is why MairuCLI exists - to catch these mistakes BEFORE they happen. Always double-check which server you're on, and always verify the path before running destructive commands.",
  "halloween_twist": "This is a real horror story, not a Halloween tale. The engineer's 'oh no' moment when they realized what they'd done is the stuff of nightmares. Don't let this be your story!",
