  "prevention_tips": [
    "Use chmod 644 for regular files (owner can write, others can only read)",
    "Use chmod 755 for executable files (owner can write, others can read and execute)",
    "Use chmod 600 for sensitive files (only owner can read and write)",
    "Never use 777 unless you have a very specific reason and understand the risks",
    "Use 'ls -l' to check current permissions before changing them",
    "Remember: 4=read, 2=write, 1=execute. Add them up for each group (owner/group/others)"
