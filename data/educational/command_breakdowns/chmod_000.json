  "real_world_impact": "chmod 000 creates a 'ghost file' - you can see it exists, but you can't read it, edit it, or delete it normally. It's like locking yourself out of your own house and throwing away the key. You'll need root/sudo access to fix it.",
  "prevention_tips": [
    "Never use chmod 000 unless you have a very specific security reason",
    "If you want to protect a file, use chmod 400 (read-only for owner)",
    "Remember: Even as the owner, 000 locks YOU out too",
    "Use 'ls -l' to check permissions before changing them",
    "If you accidentally do this, use 'sudo chmod 644 filename' to fix it",
    "For truly sensitive files, consider encryption instead of permission tricks"
