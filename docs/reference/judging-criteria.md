## Judging Process

### Stage One: Viability Check (Pass/Fail)

The first stage determines whether the project:
- Reasonably fits the hackathon theme
- Reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs (Kiro)

**Result:** Pass → Proceed to Stage Two | Fail → Eliminated

---

### Stage Two: Detailed Evaluation

All submissions that pass Stage One are evaluated based on **three equally weighted criteria**:

1. **Potential Value** (33.3%)
2. **Implementation** (33.3%)
3. **Quality and Design** (33.3%)

---

## Criterion 1: Potential Value (33.3%)

### Definition
The extent to which the solution can be widely useful, easy to use, and accessible.

### Evaluation Factors

#### Market Uniqueness
- How unique or saturated is the market with these kinds of applications/solutions?
- Does the project fill a gap or offer a fresh perspective?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Unique combination: CLI safety + education + entertainment
- Existing tools: `sl` (joke only), `thefuck` (correction only)
- MairuCLI: Comprehensive educational experience

#### User Interface
- Is the UI intuitive?
- Does it bring the app functionality to the next level?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Halloween theme makes errors memorable
- ASCII art provides visual impact
- Educational messages teach, not just warn

#### Need and Scalability
- Is there a clear need for this solution?
- Does it have extensibility or scalability?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Clear need: Engineers make CLI mistakes daily
- Extensible: Pattern database can grow
- Scalable: Community can contribute patterns

---

## Criterion 2: Implementation (33.3%)

### Definition
How well the idea leverages Kiro. Judges must understand how effectively Kiro was used to develop the project.

### Evaluation Factors

#### Variety of Kiro Features
- How many different Kiro features/capabilities were used?
- Were they impactful in project development?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- ✅ Spec-Driven Development (requirements → design → tasks)
- ✅ Steering files (code standards, theme guidelines)
- ✅ Meeting logs (decision-making process)
- ✅ Chat context (#File references)
- ❓ Hooks (if time permits)

#### Depth of Understanding
- How deep is the understanding of Kiro features?
- What benefits were gained from using Kiro?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Complete Spec workflow documented
- Steering effectiveness tested and proven
- Learning journey documented (language barrier overcome)
- Strategic decisions explained

#### Experimentation and Strategic Decisions
- How much experimentation was done?
- What strategic decisions were made about Kiro usage?

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Kiro features analysis document
- Documented decision to skip MCP (too complex)
- Prioritization by ROI (Steering > Hooks > MCP)
- Honest assessment of limitations

---

## Criterion 3: Quality and Design (33.3%)

### Definition
Creativity, originality, and polished design of the project.

### Evaluation Factors

#### Unique Resources
- Finding and using unique public resources like datasets

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- CLI_Troubled.md: Comprehensive CLI dangers catalog
- Real-world incident examples
- Community-sourced horror stories

#### Unique Problem-Solving
- Solving a challenge in a unique way

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- Education through entertainment (not just warnings)
- Halloween theme makes learning fun
- Builtin commands for realistic CLI experience

#### Delightful Experiences
- Building in delightful UI experiences or other thoughtful choices

**MairuCLI Strategy:**
- ASCII art responses
- Typo entertainment (sl → steam locomotive)
- Color-coded Halloween theme
- Wordplay in messages ("YOU'RE FIRED" = 解雇 + fire)

---

## Tie Breaking

If two or more submissions are tied:

1. Compare scores on **Potential Value** (first criterion)
2. If still tied, compare **Implementation**
3. If still tied, compare **Quality and Design**
4. If still tied, judges vote

**Implication:** Potential Value is the most important tie-breaker.
