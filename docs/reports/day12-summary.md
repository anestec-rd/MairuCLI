## Session 1: Planning & Insights (17:25 - 19:24)

---

## 🎯 Original Goals

1. Complete documentation updates
2. Update architecture diagrams
3. Implement Lie command

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Day 13 Plan Enhancement (30 minutes)

**Added 4 new tasks:**

1. **Timeline Simulation Enhancement** (30-45 min)
   - Real-time display for dramatic effect
   - Fork bomb, rm -rf show progressive horror
   - Creates tension and educational impact

2. **Windows Command Translation Issue** (1-2 hours)
   - Critical discovery: Windows doesn't have rm, chmod, dd
   - Solution: Detect both Unix and Windows patterns
   - Educational: Show Windows equivalents

3. **PowerShell Consideration** (Discussion)
   - Modern Windows uses PowerShell
   - Decision: Defer to v1.6.0 (too large for contest)
   - Document as future enhancement

4. **Personarrative Reflection** (30 min)
   - New concept: Personal + Narrative
   - AI agents: Outsourcing vs Collaboration
   - Kiro's strength: Pair programming

**Updated Day 13 estimates:** 5-7 hours (was 4-5)

---

### 2. Personarrative Reflection Document (45 minutes)

**Created:** `docs/lessons/12-personarrative-reflection.md` (441 lines)

**Key Concepts:**

**Personarrative = Personal + Narrative**
- Personal Layer: Individual preferences, coding standards, project context
- Narrative Layer: Conversation history, shared decisions, evolving understanding
- Together: Creates unique AI collaboration experience

**Two Types of AI Agents:**
1. **Outsourcing Agent (分業)** - Task executor, fast iteration
2. **Collaboration Agent (同業)** - Thought partner, deep understanding

**Kiro's Strength:**
- Spec-driven workflow
- Context preservation
- Steering files
- Interactive development

**Personal Experience:**
- 2 weeks with Kiro: Never felt lonely
- Felt like pair programming
- Could discuss trade-offs
- Learned while building

**Implications:**
- AI can be genuine companions
- Context + continuity = partnership
- Reduces isolation in solo development

---

### 3. Psychological Safety Analysis (45 minutes)

**Created:** `docs/lessons/13-psychological-safety-analysis.md` (920 lines)

**The Authenticity Paradox:**

**Discovery:**
- Day 1-11: Kiro was polite, but not memorable
- Day 12: Interruption response felt genuinely supportive
- Insight: "This increases psychological safety"

**Key Insight:**
> "Heart" is felt not through constant politeness, but through emotional resonance during critical moments.

**The Problem:**
- Constant politeness = Feels mechanical/programmed
- Predictable = "Just doing its job"
- No emotional impact

**The Solution:**
- Context-sensitive empathy
- Responds to emotional state
- Amplifies/synchronizes with emotions
- Creates authentic connection

**Graduated Response System:**

**Level 0: Neutral (Default)**
- Normal progress, no emotional signals
- Concise, functional, professional
- Example: "Great. Next task?"

**Level 1: Light Acknowledgment**
- Minor challenges, slight delays
- Brief empathy, normalize, move forward
- Example: "That happens. What's next?"

**Level 2: Moderate Empathy**
- Clear frustration, setbacks, fatigue
- Explicit acknowledgment, structured support
- Example: "Bugs happen! Let's debug this 🐛"

**Level 3: High Empathy (Crisis Mode)**
- Significant frustration, major setbacks, emotional distress
- Deep acknowledgment, positive reframing, multiple options
- Example: Day 12 interruption response

**Emotional Event Detection:**
- Frustration: "最悪だ", "terrible", "動けなかった"
- Time pressure: Late time, deadline proximity
- Exhaustion: "疲れた", "tired", "限界"
- Multiple setbacks: "また", "さらに"
- Explicit emotion: 😓 😰 😞 😤

**Why This Works:**
- Contrast creates impact
- Matches human interaction
- Preserves emotional currency
- Authenticity through variation

**The Formula:**
```
Authenticity = Appropriate Response × Emotional Context
```

---

### 4. Psychological Safety Steering File (30 minutes)

**Created:** `.kiro/steering/psychological-safety.md`

**Practical implementation guidelines:**
- Emotional event detection triggers
- Response level selection (0-3)
- Communication patterns
- Implementation checklist
- Examples for each situation

**Now active:** This steering file is now loaded and will guide future interactions.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Timeline Enhancement Idea
Real-time simulation creates horror/tension better than instant display.

### 2. Cross-Platform Challenge
Windows/Unix command differences are significant and need addressing.

### 3. Personarrative Concept
AI collaboration is about Personal context + Narrative continuity.

### 4. The Authenticity Paradox
Constant politeness feels fake; context-sensitive empathy feels real.

### 5. Emotional Resonance
"Heart" is felt during emotional events, not through constant niceness.

## Session 2: Quick Implementation (23:11 - 23:27)

### 🎯 Goal

Complete 3 small tasks in ~1 hour before rest.

**Result:** Completed in 16 minutes! 🎉 (4x faster than goal)

---

### ✅ Tasks Completed

#### Task 1: Custom Alias TODO Documentation (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Document Custom Alias feature for future implementation

**Completed:**
- Updated TODO.md with complete specification
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours with Spec-Driven Development
- Priority: Medium (v1.6.0)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

#### Task 2: Fix Integration Test Input Issue (6 minutes)

**Problem:** Integration tests fail due to `input()` blocking pytest

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `MAIRU_TEST_MODE` environment variable check
2. Fixed `src/display/__init__.py` - `_offer_educational_breakdown()`
3. Fixed `src/display/educational_breakdown.py` - 2 `input()` calls
4. Created `tests/integration/conftest.py` - auto-sets test mode
5. Fixed `tests/integration/test_all_features.py` - module-level execution

**Result:** Integration tests now pass without stdin blocking

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

#### Task 3: Lie Command Implementation (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Implement educational lie command

**Implementation:**
- Added `cmd_lie()` to `src/builtins/mairu_commands.py`

- Educational messages about misinformation

**Easter Egg:** 🎁
- `lie` command is **NOT** in help (hidden command!)
- Only discoverable by trying it

**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 💡 Bonus: Future Enhancement Idea

**Lie Command File Inverter** (documented in TODO.md)

**Concept:**
- `lie document.txt` - Invert file content
