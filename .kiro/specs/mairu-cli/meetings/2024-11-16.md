# MairuCLI Development Meeting Log - 2025-11-16

## Meeting 1: Project Direction Pivot

### Attendees
- Developer (Japanese, primary)
- Kiro AI Assistant

### Key Decisions

#### 1. Project Name Change
- **Previous:** Hanged-up CLI (pure horror theme)
- **New:** MairuCLI (まいるCLI)
  - Etymology:
    - "Mairu" (参る) = to be troubled, to surrender
    - Wordplay on "Kiro" → "Mairu"
  - Pronunciation: My-ru CLI

#### 2. Theme Shift
- **From:** Dark horror with psychological elements
- **To:** Halloween-style comedic horror with educational value
- **Reason:** Team members prefer lighter, more comedic approach rather than pure horror

#### 3. Core Concept
**"Engineering Literacy / Security Education × Horror Entertainment"**

Target audience: Engineers/Programmers who experience daily CLI fears

#### 4. Key Features Identified

**A. Dangerous Command Interception**
- Intercept destructive commands before execution
- Display horror-themed warnings instead of executing
- Example: `rm -rf /` → "YOU'RE FIRED" message + burning man ASCII art
  - Wordplay: "fired" (解雇) + "fire" (炎)

**B. Typo Entertainment**
- Famous command typos trigger custom animations
- Example: `ls` → `sl` typo → Steam Locomotive animation
- Replace generic "command not found" with themed responses

**C. Visual Design**
- Halloween color palette:
  - Orange (橙)
  - Chocolate (茶)
  - Green (緑)
  - Purple (紫)
  - Red (赤)
- Pop and friendly aesthetic, not dark/scary

#### 5. Hackathon Category
**Frankenstein** - Stitching together:
- CLI functionality

- Time constraint: 40 hours (5 days × 8 hours)
- Need to demonstrate Kiro usage for hackathon judging
- Developer has limited time to learn all Kiro features

### Key Realization
**Honest Assessment:** Neither the developer nor the AI assistant has complete knowledge of all Kiro features. Rather than over-promising, we decided to focus on features we can confidently implement and demonstrate.

### Kiro Features Analysis

#### Created Document: `kiro-features-analysis.md`
Analyzed Kiro features by:
- Applicability to MairuCLI
- Learning curve vs. demonstration value
- Time investment required
- Risk assessment

#### Feature Categorization

**Tier 1: Must Use (High Confidence)**
1. ✅ **Spec-Driven Development**
2. ✅ **Meeting Logs**
3. ✅ **Chat Context Features**
4. 🔄 **Steering** (Implemented Today)

**Tier 2: Should Use (If Time Permits)**
5. ❓ **Hooks** (To Be Evaluated)

**Tier 3: Skip for Hackathon**
6. ❌ **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

### Steering Files Created

#### File 1: `.kiro/steering/mairu-cli-standards.md`
**Purpose:** Guide AI to generate consistent, high-quality code

#### File 2: `.kiro/steering/halloween-theme.md`
**Purpose:** Maintain consistent Halloween party aesthetic

### Strategic Decisions

#### Decision 1: Focus on Demonstrable Value
- 40 hours is limited
- Better to deeply demonstrate 3-4 features than superficially use 10
- Quality over quantity for judging criteria

#### Decision 2: Honest Documentation
